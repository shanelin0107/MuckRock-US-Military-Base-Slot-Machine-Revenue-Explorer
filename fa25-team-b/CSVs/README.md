# CSVs Folder

This folder stores all extracted and processed data files used for analysis and visualization. CSV files are generated using Python scripts in the **PDF Extraction** folder, which parse and transform PDF documents into structured tabular formats.

## Folder Structure & Contents

### **District Revenue**
Primary dataset for base revenue analysis (Base Questions 1 & 2).

- **District_Revenue_filtered_FY20-FY24_final.csv** (Primary data source)
  - **Columns**: Service, Region, Base, Location, Month, Year, Amount
  - **Description**: Consolidated district revenue data across military bases for FY2020–FY2024
  - **Generated by**: District revenue extraction scripts in PDF Extraction folder
  - **Status**: Complete and validated

### **FY2020-2024 Asset Report Final**
Extracted asset report data for base analysis.

- Contains asset valuation and inventory information by base and fiscal year
- Used primarily for Base Question 3 analysis
- Organized by fiscal year subdirectories

### **Financial Statements**
Processed financial data extracted from military financial reports.

- Includes revenue summaries, expense breakdowns, and budget allocations by region/base
- Organized by fiscal year

### **Marine Revenue**
Marine-specific revenue data for naval facilities.

- Contains revenue streams specific to Marine Corps installations
- Includes geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) for mapping
- File: `Marine_Revenue_FY20-FY24_detail_with_gps.csv`

### **Navy Revenue**
Navy-specific revenue data for naval installations.

- Covers Navy bases globally including forward-deployed locations
- Includes GPS coordinates for geospatial analysis

### **bases.csv**
Reference file containing base metadata.

- **Created**: Manually curated using geographic databases and Adobe Express
- **Purpose**: Provides geospatial reference and standardized base identifiers
- **Note**: This file was **not** generated by the Python extraction scripts; it is maintained separately for consistency

### **Revenue Comparison_C.xlsx**
Consolidated comparison spreadsheet (optional reference).

- Cross-tabulation of revenue by base, service, region, and fiscal year
- Useful for quick validation and high-level comparisons

## Data Quality Notes

### Known Characteristics
- **FY2024 Data**: Incomplete (partial year data); use with caution in trend analysis
- **Base Name Standardization**: Some entries have been normalized (e.g., "Camp Hanson" → "Camp Hansen"); refer to mapping in processing scripts
- **Missing Values**: Represented as 0 or NaN depending on context; check extraction scripts for handling details
- **Service Branch Labels**: Standardized to "Army", "Navy", and "USMC" (Marine Corps); legacy names may appear in raw PDFs

### Data Validation Checklist
- [x] All records include Service, Base, Year, Amount fields
- [x] Year values fall within FY2020–FY2024 range
- [x] Amount values are numeric (negative values allowed for certain transaction types)
- [x] Region and Location fields have been cross-referenced with bases.csv

## Naming Conventions & Best Practices

### File Naming
- Use `snake_case` for all CSV filenames (e.g., `district_revenue_fy20_24.csv`, not `District Revenue FY20-24.csv`)
- Include fiscal year or date range in filename if applicable
- Use descriptive suffixes: `_final` (processed), `_raw` (unprocessed), `_with_gps` (includes coordinates)

### Folder Naming
- Use `PascalCase` for data category folders (e.g., `District_Revenue`, `Marine_Revenue`, `Financial_Statements`)
- Keep names concise and unambiguous

### CSV Structure
- First row must contain column headers (no multi-row headers)
- Use consistent column names across similar files (e.g., all revenue files should have "Service", "Base", "Year", "Amount")
- Data types: numeric amounts as float or integer, dates as YYYY-MM-DD format
- Ensure no leading/trailing whitespace in column names

## Submission & Maintenance Workflow

### When Adding New Data Files
1. **Place file** in appropriate folder (or create new subfolder with descriptive name using `PascalCase`)
2. **Validate** CSV structure (headers, data types, completeness)
3. **Document** in this README:
   - Filename and location
   - Column names and brief descriptions
   - Date generated or data range covered
   - Any known issues or limitations
4. **Commit** with descriptive message:
   ```
   git add CSVs/[folder]/[filename].csv
   git commit -m "Add [brief description]: district revenue FY2024 Q3 data"
   git push origin Team-B-Sprint
   ```

### Updating Existing Files
- If modifying an existing CSV, append `_v2`, `_updated`, or date suffix to versioned backups
- Update this README with version history and change notes
- Use `git commit -m "Update [filename]: [change description and reason]"`

### Requesting Changes or Reporting Issues
- Create an issue in GitHub if data validation fails or columns are missing
- Include filename, error description, and affected rows if applicable
- Tag relevant team members (e.g., PDF Extraction subteam)

## Notes

- When running data extraction scripts from the **PDF Extraction** folder, save output CSV files here for consistency.
- Ensure all CSV files follow naming conventions and include proper headers.
- Before using data in analysis notebooks, verify the expected columns and data ranges align with actual file contents.
