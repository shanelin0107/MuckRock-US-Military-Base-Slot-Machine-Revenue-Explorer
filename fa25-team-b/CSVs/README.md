# CSVs Folder

This folder stores all extracted data files.

The CSV files here are generated using the Python scripts located in the **PDF Extraction** folder. These scripts handle the parsing and transformation of PDF data into structured tabular formats.

## Existing Files

- **Revenue Comparison_C.xlsx**  
  This file was **not** generated by the Python extraction scripts.  
  It was created separately using **Adobe Express**, and is included here for reference and comparison.

## Notes

- When running data extraction scripts from the **PDF Extraction** folder, save your output CSV files here for consistency.
- Ensure filenames are clear and descriptive (e.g., `sales_summary_q4.csv`, `product_performance.csv`).
