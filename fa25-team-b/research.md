## Proposed Methods
Because extracting financial statement information and charts from PDF files is central to this project—and financial reports often have hierarchical structures with tables that mix numbers and text—we evaluated the major Python packages for this task using the following criteria:

- **Table detection**: Accurately identify borders, headers, and cell contents.  
- **OCR support**: Provide OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capability, since some charts may come from scanned documents.  
- **Numerical accuracy**: Minimize errors in recognizing numerical data.  

### Tool Comparison

We reviewed several Python libraries for extracting financial data from PDFs and compared them on three criteria: table detection, OCR support, and numerical accuracy.

- **pdfplumber**: Provides excellent table detection, accurately identifying cells and contents using multiple border-detection strategies. Although it lacks built-in OCR, it achieves high numerical accuracy, handling layouts cleanly even in complex tables.

- **tabula-py**: Uses a Java-based detection method that works well for multi-page tables but struggles with irregular or complex layouts. It does not have built-in OCR, and while it is accurate on simple tables, formatting issues often appear in more complex ones. Its numerical accuracy is considered medium.

- **Camelot**: Uses advanced computer vision for precise border and layout detection. It is limited to text-based PDFs (no OCR support), but when applicable, it delivers excellent table detection and high numerical accuracy.

- **pypdf**: Offers only basic text extraction and does not include table detection or OCR capabilities. Because of this, its numerical accuracy is low, as general text parsing often introduces errors.

- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: Includes a fair-quality built-in table extractor and supports OCR via Tesseract. While not as strong in table detection, it can be useful for scanned documents. Its numerical accuracy is medium, suitable for custom extraction tasks, though it often requires tailored code for reliability.

There is no single PDF-handling tool that can fully accomplish our task. Each type of chart requires a different tool for extraction, and we will need to manually determine which one performs best depending on the structure of the document.
