            # Project Details

            This dashboard analyzes U.S. military slot-machine revenue across Army, Navy, and Marine Corps installations worldwide from FY2020–FY2024. 
            The goal is to visualize geographic patterns, fiscal-year trends, and top-earning bases.

            ## Process

            1. Extraction: Parsing raw PDF revenue reports across multiple fiscal years
            2. Transformation: Cleaning and standardizing branch, district, installation names, and monthly totals
            3. Enrichment: Adding latitude and longitude through base-based geocoding
            4. Loading: Publishing processed tables to Datasette with interactive dashboards and maps
